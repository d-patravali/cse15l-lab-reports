**Step 1**: Install Visual Studio Code onto your computer. Go to the VSCode download page: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). There will be several download options, which are dependent on which operating system your computer runs on. My computer is a mac, so I used the mac download option to install Visual Studio Code.

**Step 2**: Remotely connect to the provided server through your course specific CSE15L account. First, make sure that you have a way to use the Command-line Interface. If you are using a Mac, you can just use the Terminal application. If you are on Windows, download Git Bash, and access the terminal thorugh the VSCode application that you downloaded earlier. Once you have access to the Command-line, use the command 'ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu' except rather than 'zz', use your individual account numbers from your course specific CSE15L account. Enter your account password when prompted to, and you should gain access to the server.

**Step3**: Run some commands. Once you have remote access to the server, practice using some of the commands you learned in class to carry out certain tasks like listing the contents of your current directory, changing your current directory, and accessing the contacts of your peers directories throughy the server (by using their individual course specific CSE15L account details).
