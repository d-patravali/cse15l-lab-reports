## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario
### New Question
### Title: Trouble debugging a syntax error in my Bash Script
### Category: Debugging
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I am using a Mac, and I am editing my Bash Script with VSCode. I am also using VSCode's terminal to run my Bash Script

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**
